Hi, I will be working my first GitHub assignment wherein I will be applying my newly acquired knowledge about Git commands. Listed below what I have remembered for my reference.
1. Create Repository (GitHub)
2. Check Public option
3. Check Add README file
4. copy your repository to your local machine by going to CODE (GITHUB), choose the SSH click COPY icon
5. Open your terminal
6. Choose your proper folder
7. Run the command: git clone 'paste the copied SSH'
8. cd the newly created folder
9. Check you should have the README file in it.
10. Done

11. git add . or name of the file
12. git status
13. git commit -m "---"
14. git status
15. git log
16. git push origin main
17. then check your repository
